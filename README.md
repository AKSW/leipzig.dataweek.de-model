# The Model for the Data Week Page

Check out [https://dataweek.de/](https://dataweek.de/).

The Page Sources are at [AKSW/leipzig.dataweek.de](https://github.com/AKSW/leipzig.dataweek.de).

| URL     | File | Description |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| https://2025.dataweek.de/ | `graph` | `event + program`, the final graph with all combined data. |
| https://event.2025.dataweek.de/ | `event` | General Data Week graph. |
| https://program.2025.dataweek.de/ | `program` | The program. It is generated by DI. |

Only the `event.ttl` file should be edited manually, all other files are generated with the Taskfile.

```
$ eval $(cmemc -c aksw.eccenca.dev config eval)
$ task
```

## Hints for editing event.ttl

* All subevents for which we want to show a resource should use the same domain, e.g. dataweek.de
* Subevents should have a short title to show in tabs, e.g. LSWT2025 as a purl:title
* The schema:organizer object should have a dct:description
* schema:affiliations and schema:memberOf range objects should have labels with language tag
